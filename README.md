# nodeSpeed IDE
nodeSpeed IDE is a server for providing hosted version of the popular code editor [Brackets](http://brackets.io/). 

ndoeSpeed IDE is initially based on the [Brackets Server](https://github.com/rabchev/brackets-server) project. Thanks to [Boyan Rabchev](https://github.com/rabchev) for starting this project. As it is no longer being actively maintained, we have decided to launch our fork as a project with a new name.  

nodeSpeed IDE uses a node.js Express server and includes an implementation of [xterm.js](https://github.com/sourcelair/xterm.js/) toprovide browser based terminal access. 

The Brackets code editor can be loaded directly in a web browser. It doesnâ€™t require additional installations or browser extensions. Brackets works just like the desktop version, except that all projects and files reside on the server instead of the local file system. 

nodeSpeed IDE is mainly intended to be used with an implementation with Docker containers, making it fast and easy to spin up and run a hosted development environment. All of our testing is therefore done by running in a Docker environment. 

nodeSpeed IDE is currently based on Brackets 1.8. To check the current verion of Brackets source used in the server, please see [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/whoGloo/nodespeed-ide/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Installation
Install the nodeSpeed IDE with one of the following options: 
- By cloning building and runinng
- By building a docker image and running the IDE from one or more containers using Docker
- By pulling and running a pre-built Docker image `whogloo/nodespeed-ide` and using this in `docker run` scripts.
- Sign up for an account on [Spinups.io](https://spinups.io), spin up an instance of nodeSpeed Development and get started in minutes.  

## Usage Examples
### Command line
To start from command line, use a command like the one below from the IDE installation directory: 

```
node nodespeedide --supp-dir /projects/.brackets-server -j /projects
```

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure the **/projects** directory exists.

All arguments are optional.

| Short Option | Long Option      | Default Value             | Description
|--------------|------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
| `-p <prot>`  | `--port`         | `6800`                    | TCP port on which Brackets server is listening.
| `-j <dir>`   | `--proj-dir`     | `/projects `              | Root directory for projects. Directories above this root cannot be accessed.
| `-s <dir>`   | `--supp-dir`     | `/projects/.brackets-srv` | Root directory for Brackets supporting files such as user extensions, configurations and state persistence.
| `-d`         | `--user-domains` | `false`                   | Allows Node domains to be loaded from user extensions.

**NOTE:** Some Brackets extensions require external Node.js process, called node domain. Node domains run on the server, thereby allowing arbitrary code to be executed on the server through custom extensions.  Since this imposes very serious security and stability risks, Brackets Server will not load nor execute domains from user extensions, unless `-d` option is specified.

**NOTE:** The default values for `projectsDir` and `supportDir` are different when nodeSpeed IDE is initiated from code. They are respectively `./projects` and `./brackets`, relative to the current working directory.

Options:

| Option           | Default Value     | Description
|------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
| httpRoot         | `/brackets`       | Defines the root HTTP endpoint for Brackets Server (http://yourdomain.com/brackets).
| projectsDir      | `./projects`      | Root directory for projects. Directories above this root cannot be accessed.
| supportDir       | `./brackets`      | Root directory for Brackets supporting files such as user extensions, configurations and state persistence.
| allowUserDomains | `false`           | Allows Node domains to be loaded from user extensions.

### From Docker
To run from Docker, the following steps are needed. 

##### Docker Image
Build image of nodeSpeed IDE using the Dockerfile included in the project and and the files in the `docker`sub-directory 

or  

Pull a pre-built image from [whogloo/nodespeed-ide](https://hub.docker.com/r/whogloo/nodespeed-ide/) on Docker Hub. 

#### Run with Docker 

Create a data container to store code and files so that they are not lost during updates of the image: 

```
docker create --name nodespeed-ide-data -v /projects -v /projects/.brackets-server -v /home/nodespeed -v /tmp busybox 
```

Run nodeSpeed IDE with Docker from the command line: 

 ```
 docker run -d --name nodespeed-ide --volumes-from nodespeed-ide-data -p 6800:6800 -p 8080:8080 -p 3000:3000 -p 9485:9485 whogloo/nodespeed-ide 
 ```
 
 **NB: ** The following ports must be exposed from the Docker container: 
 
 - `6800` Default IDE port
 - `8080` Terminal Port 
 - `3000` Port for testing applicatiosn running inside the container
 - `9485` Web Sockets access for terminal instance
 
## Suggested Brackets extensions
As part of the hosted version of nodeSpeed IDE (ndoeSpeed Development), a number of Brackets extensions have been developed or forked and updated to work in the nodeSpeed IDE. These extensions add extra functionality to the IDE in various ways. 

The following is a list of suggested nodeSpeed IDE specific extensions: 

- [**brackets-nodespeed-custom**](https://github.com/whoGloo/brackets-nodespeed-custom): This is our main custom project and it adds extra menu items to the IDE, including extra navigation menu items for **Terminal** (nodeSpeed Terminal in a separate browser tab) and **Preview** (preview of applications run from the IDE using port 3000). 
- [**nodespeed-terminal**](https://github.com/whoGloo/nodespeed-terminal): Node Express project with Golden Layout used to implement a multi instance terminal that can run in a separate tab browser, attaching to the bash shell of the IDE machine (normally a Docker container)
- [**brackets-file-upload**](https://github.com/whoGloo/brackets-file-upload): Extension to provide upload and download of files and directories from the IDE
- [**brackets-duplicate-extension**](https://github.com/whoGloo/brackets-duplicate-extension): Extension to provide support for copying and duplicating files and folders

Custom forks of existing Brackets Extensions: 
- [**brackets-git**](https://github.com/whoGloo/brackets-git): Custom fork of [brackets-git](https://github.com/zaggino/brackets-git). Kudos to [Martin Zagora](https://github.com/zaggino). 
- [**brackets-npm-extension**](https://github.com/whoGloo/brackets-npm-registry): Custom fork of [brackets-npm-registry](https://github.com/zaggino/brackets-npm-registry). Kudos to [Martin Zagora](https://github.com/zaggino). 

It has been necessary to modify some of the extensions for them to work with the IDE, as many of the existing extensions are dependent on local OS and filesystem features. 

There are several other extensioons that could be recommended for a productive implementation of nodeSpeed IDE. Suggestions are welcome.
